Author : Rhea Sanjan B.R

Purpose: The purpose of this project is to automate the university result extraction process.
In colleges, teachers have to sit and enter each studentâ€™s University Seat Number,fetch the result and determine if the student has passed or failed. 
This takes plenty of time. This app automates this process. The user has to enter the starting USN and the ending USN that the user wants to fetch. 
The app displays the complete result of each student : their internal marks,external marks, total marks and if they have passed or failed , for each subject and 
also their total marks,percentage, class and their gpa(in case of CBCS) is displayed. 


Features:
Fetches marks of multiple students.
Caculates SGPA and percentage of each student.
Lists out the top 3 students.
Provides a detailed analysis of the fetched results.
Works for all semesters.
